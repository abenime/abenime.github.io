      "content": "# Building Scalable Systems\n\nAfter years of building and maintaining large-scale applications, I've learned that scalability isn't just about throwing more servers at the problem...\n\n## Key Principles\n\n### 1. Design for Failure\n\nEvery component in your system will fail at some point. The question isn't if, but when. Build your systems with this in mind.\n\n```typescript\n// Implement circuit breakers\nconst circuitBreaker = new CircuitBreaker({\n  timeout: 3000,\n  errorThreshold: 50,\n  resetTimeout: 30000\n});\n```\n\n### 2. Embrace Asynchronous Processing\n\nNot everything needs to happen in real-time. Message queues and event-driven architectures can significantly improve responsiveness.\n\n### 3. Cache Strategically\n\nCaching is powerful but comes with its own challenges. Implement cache invalidation strategies early.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nScalability is a journey, not a destination. Start with simple solutions and evolve as your needs grow.",

      "content": "# The Art of Clean Code\n\nClean code is not just about aesthetics—it's about creating software that stands the test of time...\n\n## Core Principles\n\n### Meaningful Names\n\n```typescript\n// Bad\nconst d = new Date();\nconst x = users.filter(u => u.a > 18);\n\n// Good\nconst currentDate = new Date();\nconst adultUsers = users.filter(user => user.age > 18);\n```\n\n### Single Responsibility\n\nEach function should do one thing, and do it well.\n\n### Write Tests First\n\nTDD forces you to think about the interface before implementation.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nInvest time in writing clean code today to save countless hours tomorrow.",
